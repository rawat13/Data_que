    Create visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
    Provide insights into the data distribution, relationships, and potential trends.
   
2. Linear Regression for Prediction:
    Use a dataset with a continuous target variable.
    Implement a simple linear regression model to predict the target variable based on one or more features.
    Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error.
 
3. Classification based data set(Iris Dataset):
    Work with the classic Iris dataset.
    Implement a basic classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict the species of iris flowers.
    Evaluate the model's accuracy and visualize the results.

4. Web Scraping and Data Cleaning:
    Learn web scraping using Python libraries like Beautiful Soup and requests.
    Scrape data from a website and clean it using pandas.
    Present insights or create visualizations based on the cleaned data.

5.Data Visualization with Seaborn/Matplotlib:
  Choose a dataset and create compelling visualizations using Seaborn or Matplotlib.
  Practice creating different types of plots, such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
  Add interpretations or stories to your visualizations.

B. Intermediate Level:
1. Time Series Analysis and Forecasting:
    Find a time-series dataset (e.g., stock prices, weather data).
    Perform time series analysis, including trend analysis and seasonality detection.
    Implement a forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet) and evaluate its performance.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project:
    Use NLP techniques to analyze text data (e.g., movie reviews, tweets).
    Perform sentiment analysis or build a text classification model.
    Visualize key insights from the text data.
    
3. Image Classification with CNN:
    Work with an image dataset (e.g., detecting breast cancer).
    Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
    Evaluate the model's accuracy and explore misclassifications.

4. Customer Segmentation and Clustering:
    Use customer transaction or demographic data for segmentation.
    Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify customer segments.
    Visualize and interpret the results.
    
5. Interactive Dashboards with Plotly/Dash:
    Create an interactive data dashboard using Plotly or Dash.
    Integrate multiple visualizations and allow users to interact with the data dynamically.
    Deploy the dashboard for online access.

C.Advanced Level:
1. Recommender System Implementation:
    Use collaborative filtering or content-based methods to build a recommender system.
    Work with a dataset containing user preferences or interactions.
    Evaluate the performance and explore ways to improve recommendations.
2. Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data:
   Identify anomalies in time-series data using advanced techniques.
